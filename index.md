The closest place to get food from the [South Campus Center Classroom](https://www.google.com/maps/place/UW+South+Campus+Center/@47.6495125,-122.3129862,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x549014ec0573d0fd:0x92c36f77d79c29d7!8m2!3d47.6495089!4d-122.3107975) is [The Rotunda](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Rotunda/@47.6511327,-122.3127829,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x549014edcc167af3:0xb5ac65b12f1dabaf!8m2!3d47.6511327!4d-122.3105889).
