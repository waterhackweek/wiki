# Travel

Seattle-Tacoma International Airport offers a range of connections to the University of Washington Campus.

The [Link light rail](https://www.soundtransit.org/Schedules/Link-light-rail) is an easy, great way to get to the UW from the airport. It stops by the airport about every 5-15 minutes and has its final stop at the UW campus; just a 15-minute walk from the venue. 

From the arrivals hall at Sea-Tac Airport, follow the signs for Link Light Rail; the station is a short walk from the terminal on the far side of the parking garage. Tickets must be purchased at the station before boarding. The cost is $2.75 and can be paid in cash or with a credit/debit card. Take the train to the last stop (UW).

Taxiâ€™s and uber/lyft are also available from the airport. Note that for uber/lyft you will meet the car in the 3rd floor parking lot for pick up.

# Lodging

You are responsible for making your travel and lodging arrangements. Please plan to arrive in Seattle by Sunday, March 22nd and be here until the evening of Friday, March 27th in order to participate fully in the Waterhackweek. 

Options for lodging: Hotels that are close to the UW campus include the Marriott [Residence Inn](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/hotel-rooms/seaud-residence-inn-seattle-university-district/), [Watertown Hotel](https://www.staypineapple.com/watertown-hotel-seattle-wa) and the [University Inn](https://www.staypineapple.com/university-inn-seattle-wa). You are also welcome to book an airbnb or making other lodging arrangements.

# Parking

The nearest parking garage is the South Campus Garage, which is conveniently attached to the event location, the South Campus Center. To get a pass, you will need stop by the [nearby gatehouse on NE Columbia Road](uw.edu/maps/?south-gatehouse-ne-columbia-road). However, the rate to park in that garage is $15 per day.

The [self-serve parking lots](https://transportation.uw.edu/park/visitor/self-serve) tend to be cheaper, but are not as close. In particular, the E18 and E1 lotsare $6.75 per week day, but require a 20-25 minute walk to the South Campus Center.

# Transit

If you'd prefer not to drive, there are public transportation options to get you to Waterhackweek. 

The event is a 10-15 minute walk from the last stop on the Link light rail: the [University of Washington Station](https://www.soundtransit.org/ride-with-us/stations/link-light-rail-stations/university-washington-station). 

Furthermore, there are a wide range of [King County Metro bus routes](https://tripplanner.kingcounty.gov/) that serve the campus area. Bus fares are $2.75 (and drivers do NOT have change).
