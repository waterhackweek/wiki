# Overview

We are currently recruiting sponsors for the 2020 Waterhackweek. 

# Roles and sponsorship tiers

 Sponsors will benefit from advertising their company with our locally and globally-reaching eScience Institute affiliates, networking with data scientists, discovering new technology and recruitment opportunities, and supporting innovative research. Other opportunities include travel sponsorship for participants on an as-needed basis to increase program accessibility. 
 If you are interested in becoming a sponsor, please contact Jane Koh at janekoh1@uw.edu.

As a hackweek sponsor for this event, your number one responsibility is also to adhere to the hackweek [code of conduct](https://waterhackweek.github.io/wiki/code_of_conduct.html) designed by the Seattle data science community. Your visibility throughout the event provides you with a unique opportunity to demonstrate professional, respectful behaviors that other participants can emulate throughout the week. 

# What can sponsors expect to gain from this experience?

This is an opportunity to build new contacts in the community, recruit students and collaborators and generate new project ideas.  Participants will also have the opportunity to learn about you and your activities.
