Waterhackweek is dedicated to providing a harassment-free learning experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the organizers.
Please refer here for [guidelines on how to interact at Waterhackweek](Ways_to_interact_at_Waterhackweek_2019_FINAL.pdf).
Harassment includes, but is not limited to: 
* Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion.
* Sexual images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Harassing photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Inappropriate physical contact
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the organisers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from Waterhackweek with no refund.

Waterhackweek organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants. We expect participants to follow these rules at all the event venues and event-related social activities.

Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of Waterhackweek for everyone. If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible to one of the organizers (Nicoleta Cristea in person or at <a href="mailto:cristn@uw.edu">cristn@uw.edu</a>). 

If you have experienced or observed a Code of Conduct Violation (unethical or unprofessional behavior), we have outlined multiple options for you to report.  
 
For an immediate in person response to discuss concerns or next steps, contact Waterhackweek Program Director: Christina Bandaragoda, cband@uw.edu.

For an  informal, neutral, and confidential resource  that can help the University community address complaints and/or challenging situations, contact the Office of the Ombud, 206-543-6028. ombuds@uw.edu, www.uw.edu/ombud.   For individuals who are uncertain about whether they want to pursue a formal complaint, but would like someone to speak to, the Ombud office would be a good place to start and they can assist with navigating the different resources on campus.

If an individual would like to file a formal complaint around a concern about discrimination, they can contact University Complaint Investigation and Resolution Office (UCIRO):       https://www.washington.edu/compliance/uciro/,    206-616-2028,   uciro@uw.edu.

If an individual would like to file a formal complaint around a concern about sexual misconduct, they can contact the Title IX Office:         https://www.washington.edu/compliance/tixio/,      206-616-5334,     tixinv@uw.edu.

For concerns/complaints that fall outside of these two categories, but are clear violations of the conduct code, we would recommend that the starting place would be the department in charge of the event.
