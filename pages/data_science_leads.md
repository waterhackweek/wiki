# Roles and Responsibilities

The data scientist lead:

* will be responsible for supporting at least one [project](https://waterhackweek.github.io/wiki/project_guidelines.html), and expected to float around as needed.
* will advise teams regarding applying best data science practices and methodologies. 
* will help coordinate a Github workflow that works best by facilitating team conversations. 
* enable and encourage participants to solve their problems in a way that builds confidence in their skills. For example, look for how people improve from their baseline level over the week and point those improvements out to them. 
* any group or individual can ask any data scientist for help. 
* interact with as many people as possible.
* be in tune with progress toward individual goals (discrete daily personal brief checking).
